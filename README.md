# STARTED: Dec 1, 2023

I thought a few years: do I need this or not?

so... finally I have started.

## repo created: Jan 1, 2024

and on the first day I just added this readme and all of the solutions which are completed. \
(that was a plan, but I didn't have time for it)

### missing solutions which are already done

- Itertools
- Collections

I will continue to add solutions as I go along. \
\+ possible daily, with 1 new solution, 2 new solutions...

so, that's it at the moment
